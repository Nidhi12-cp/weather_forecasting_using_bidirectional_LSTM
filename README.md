This project builds a smart weather forecasting system using deep learning. By analyzing past hourly weather data over several days, a Bidirectional LSTM neural network predicts the temperature 12 hours into the future.

It uses detailed climate data from the Jena weather station in Germany, leveraging multiple atmospheric features like temperature, humidity, and wind speed to make accurate forecasts.

Compared to traditional models, this approach captures complex weather patterns by looking both forward and backward in time, resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

This repository includes everything from data processing and model training to evaluation and visualization, along with an optional API to make live predictions.

Itâ€™s a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in applying advanced neural networks to real-world time series forecasting challenges.
