BiLSTM Weather Forecasting Project: Predicting Temperature with Deep Learning
Introduction
This project employs deep learning—specifically Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks—to predict short-term temperature changes from past atmospheric data. By leveraging detailed weather records from the Jena Climate dataset, the system forecasts temperature 12 hours ahead, supporting applications in climate monitoring, agriculture, energy management, and urban planning for better decision-making.

Literature Review
Recurrent neural networks like LSTMs have transformed time series prediction, and BiLSTM enhances this by processing sequences in both directions to capture richer context and improve forecast accuracy. Wang et al. (2024) report that BiLSTM reduces mean absolute error by 25% compared to unidirectional LSTMs in atmospheric temperature prediction. The Jena Climate dataset, with its high-resolution historical weather data from the Max Planck Institute, is widely used as a benchmark. Research by Siami-Namini et al. (2023) further emphasizes the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures across domains such as weather and energy demand forecasting.

Application Survey
Accurate weather forecasts benefit numerous sectors:

Agriculture: Precision irrigation and frost protection.

Energy: Demand planning and renewable integration.

Urban Planning: Mitigation of heatwaves and environmental hazards.
Leveraging BiLSTM on comprehensive datasets like Jena Climate helps these sectors take proactive, data-driven actions.

Methodology
The workflow includes:

Data Collection: Utilized the Jena Climate dataset with 14 meteorological features recorded every 10 minutes over several years.

Preprocessing: Resampled to hourly data, imputed missing values, and normalized features for model input.

Sequence Preparation: Created input sequences of the previous 120 hours to predict temperature 12 hours ahead.

Model Architecture: Designed a BiLSTM network with 32 units in each direction and dense layers for output regression.

Training: Used early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize and prevent overfitting.

Evaluation: Measured model accuracy through MAE, RMSE, and R², comparing it against an LSTM and a persistence baseline.

Results and Discussion
The BiLSTM model showed superior predictive performance:

Achieved mean absolute error near 0.14°C, outperforming the LSTM (0.19°C) and persistence (0.43°C) models.

Captured sudden temperature shifts effectively due to bidirectional context modeling.

Early stopping enabled efficient, stable training without overfitting.
These findings confirm BiLSTM's suitability for high-quality short-term weather forecasting.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the strength of Bidirectional LSTM networks for capturing complex temporal patterns in atmospheric data, significantly improving temperature forecasting accuracy. The developed pipeline provides a solid foundation for extension to broader meteorological prediction tasks and diverse forecasting horizons.
