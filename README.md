**BiLSTM Weather Forecasting Project: Predicting Weather with Deep Learning**
**Introduction:**
The project focuses on using deep learning—specifically Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks—to forecast short-term temperature changes based on past atmospheric data. By analyzing detailed weather records, the system aims to deliver more accurate temperature predictions 12 hours ahead, helping applications like climate monitoring, agriculture, and energy management make better decisions.

**Keywords:** Deep Learning, BiLSTM, Weather Forecasting, Time Series, Climate Data, Predictive Modeling

**Literature Review:**
Deep learning models have revolutionized time series forecasting, with recurrent architectures like LSTMs widely used to model sequential data. BiLSTM networks enhance this further by processing sequences both forward and backward, capturing more context and improving accuracy.
A study by Wang et al. (2024) demonstrates that BiLSTM models outperform unidirectional LSTMs in atmospheric temperature prediction by 25% in mean absolute error.
The Jena Climate dataset, sourced from the Max Planck Institute, is frequently used as a benchmark for weather prediction models, providing high-resolution historical weather data.
Research by Siami-Namini et al. (2023) highlights the efficacy of bidirectional networks in various forecasting domains including meteorology and energy demand.

**Application Survey:-**
Forecasting weather accurately benefits many sectors:

**Agriculture:** precision irrigation and frost prevention.

**Energy Management:** demand forecasting and renewable integration.

**Urban Planning:** managing heatwaves and environmental hazards.

Deploying BiLSTM models trained on rich datasets like Jena Climate enables these sectors to make proactive, data-driven decisions.

**Methodology:**
This project followed these key steps:

**Data Collection:** Utilized the Jena Climate dataset with 14 meteorological variables recorded at 10-minute intervals across multiple years.

**Preprocessing:** Resampled data to hourly intervals, handled missing values, and normalized features for deep learning compatibility.

**Sequence Generation:** Created input sequences of past 120 hours (5 days) to predict temperature 12 hours forward.

**Model Architecture:** Implemented a BiLSTM network with 32 units per direction, combined with dense layers for regression output.

**Training:** Employed early stopping and learning rate reduction to avoid overfitting and accelerate convergence.

**Evaluation:** Assessed model accuracy using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics, comparing against LSTM and persistence baseline models.

**Results and Discussion:**
The BiLSTM model consistently outperformed traditional LSTM and naive persistence models:

Achieved an MAE of approximately 0.14°C, versus 0.19°C for LSTM and 0.43°C for persistence.

Demonstrated superior handling of abrupt temperature shifts due to its bidirectional context awareness.

Training with early stopping allowed efficient convergence, preventing overfitting.

These results validate the efficiency and applicability of BiLSTM architectures for reliable short-term weather forecasting.

**Conclusion:**
This project illustrates the power of Bidirectional LSTM networks in capturing complex temporal dynamics in atmospheric data, leading to more accurate temperature forecasts. The model and pipeline offer a practical solution for meteorological applications while also serving as a solid foundation for expanding to multivariate or spatial weather prediction tasks.
